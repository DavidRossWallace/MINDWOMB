# MINDWOMB
Project blog:  https://infopurpose.com/current-projects/mindwomb/about-mindwomb

<p>This project started as a project to create a portable, virtual mind, "<a href="https://infopurpose.com/the-everymind-project">everyMind</a>," with AI and collective data intelligence abilities.</p>

<p><strong>MindWomb</strong> is basically the archetype, original everyMind and is now being specified and developed into a development environment and tool to create and manage everyMinds and related components - graph databases, machine learning models, mindset schemas, etc.</p>


<p><strong>Components and features Developed so far:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Graph database designer</li>
	<li>Database management features (input/export, create, edit ,query, update, convert, etc.</li>
	<li>Graph database explorer/data editors</li>
	<li>File/component explorer</li>
	<li>Domain &amp; index generator - generates correlated indexes of data for creating and using prediction engines on the fly</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Mindset component manager</li>
	<li>, tools for making graph data executable including editor to create runlets - encapsulated queries and functions that have input/output ports - can be chained together</li>
</ul>

<p>and more..</p>

<p>Development is ongoing and just re-posited publicly - there is a good amount of cleaning and organizing to be done to get things palatable for public consumption and participation. Thank you in advance for your patience and understanding.</p>
